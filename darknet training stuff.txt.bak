This might help :
.5R is recall for IoU>0.5 and .75R is recall for IoU>0.75
Where:
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
TP = number of detections with IoU>0.5 (0.75)
FP = number of detections with IoU<=0.5 (0.75)or detected more than once
FN = number of objects that are not detected or detected with IoU<=0.5 (0.75)
